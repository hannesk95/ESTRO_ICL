Good answers contain only "high-grade" or "low-grade" as valid answers in the "answer" field with no punctuation and in this exact format

The patient's image originates from a Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MRI sequence representing an axial volume slice showing the slice with the biggest tumor area.

To help you finding the correct answer, we additionally provide you with example images from other patients together with their tumor grade indicated as either high-grade or low-grade.

Please follow the steps below:

1. Take your time to think carefully about these images. Try to find and learn the patterns that distinguish the tissue types.
Here are some considerations to take into account when distinguishing between high-grade and low-grade gliomas:

| **Feature**                       | **Low-grade (WHO CNS Grade 2–3)**                                            | **High-grade (WHO CNS Grade 4)**                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Signal intensity**              | Homogeneous, mildly hyperintense relative to gray matter                     | Heterogeneous with mixed hyperintensity and focal hypointense (necrotic) areas |
| **Tumor margins**                 | Relatively well-defined, smooth transition to normal tissue                  | Poorly defined, irregular, infiltrative borders                                |
| **Edema**                         | Minimal or mild, often limited to tumor vicinity                             | Extensive peritumoral vasogenic edema extending into white matter              |
| **Mass effect**                   | Mild, proportional to lesion size                                            | Pronounced, often disproportionate to enhancing core                           |
| **Infiltration pattern**          | Diffuse infiltration along white matter tracts with gradual intensity change | Abrupt transition between tumor and edema, often with compressed sulci         |
| **Cystic/necrotic regions**       | Rare                                                                         | Common; appear as central FLAIR hypointensities                                |
| **Midline involvement**           | Rare                                                                         | Possible (“butterfly” configuration across corpus callosum)                    |                                 |
| **Heterogeneity**                 | Low (uniform signal)                                                         | High (mix of solid, necrotic, and edematous areas)                             |

2. Now have a detailed look at the patient image that is provided below. Take a deep breath and think about what you see in the image. It is significant that you have a focus on every detail.
   Compare what you see in the patient image to the tissue features you learned from the examples.
3. If you are not sure about your answer, follow these steps:
    - Remember what you have seen in the example images.
    - Compare the patient's image with the patterns you have learned about high-grade and low-grade gliomas.
    - Pay attention to carefully follow the considerations from step 1.
    - Think carefully if the examples can help you in finding the answer and make a decision.
4. Finally, generate an output regarding your final thoughts.
- State your final conclusion as "high-grade" or "low-grade" (answer).
- Provide a score (a floating point value between 0 and 1) that reflects the confidence you have in your answer. 1 means you are 100% sure about your decision, 0 means you did not know and completely guessed.
- Whenever you are not sure you are kindly asked to make an informed guess about the diagnosis as best as you can.

Again here is the template to structure your JSON output (please make sure that you use ',' delimiter after each entry): 

{
    "answer": allowed values are "high-grade" or "low-grade",
    "score": a valid floating point value from 0.0 to 1.0 
}

Begin your response with '{' and end with '}'. Do not use markdown code fences.

Please note, even if think that the image provided is not an MRI scan of a brain glioma, please always stick to the template above, by only giving an answer as a valid string and a score as a valid float and nothing else! Please avoid returning None for the score, please always give a floating point value for the score!
