Good answers contain only "high-grade" or "low-grade" as valid answers in the "answer" field with no punctuation and in this exact format

The patient's image originates from a Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MRI sequence representing an axial volume slice showing the slice with the biggest tumor area.

1. Have a look at the patient image that is provided below. Take a deep breath and think about wheter you see patterns of high-grade or low-grade brain glioma given all your knowledge you have in radiology.
2. Finalize your answer with a score. As an example, a score of 1 means you are 100% sure to see a high-grade brain glioma, a score of 0 means you see a low-grade brain glioma in the image. A score close to 0.6 means you had to guess, but you tend towards seeing a high-grade brain glioma. The answer should contain "high-grade" or "low-grade" only. 

Here are some considerations to take into account when distinguishing between high-grade and low-grade gliomas:

| **Feature**                       | **Low-grade (WHO CNS Grade 2–3)**                                            | **High-grade (WHO CNS Grade 4)**                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Signal intensity**              | Homogeneous, mildly hyperintense relative to gray matter                     | Heterogeneous with mixed hyperintensity and focal hypointense (necrotic) areas |
| **Tumor margins**                 | Relatively well-defined, smooth transition to normal tissue                  | Poorly defined, irregular, infiltrative borders                                |
| **Edema**                         | Minimal or mild, often limited to tumor vicinity                             | Extensive peritumoral vasogenic edema extending into white matter              |
| **Mass effect**                   | Mild, proportional to lesion size                                            | Pronounced, often disproportionate to enhancing core                           |
| **Infiltration pattern**          | Diffuse infiltration along white matter tracts with gradual intensity change | Abrupt transition between tumor and edema, often with compressed sulci         |
| **Cystic/necrotic regions**       | Rare                                                                         | Common; appear as central FLAIR hypointensities                                |
| **Midline involvement**           | Rare                                                                         | Possible (“butterfly” configuration across corpus callosum)                    |                                |
| **Heterogeneity**                 | Low (uniform signal)                                                         | High (mix of solid, necrotic, and edematous areas)                             |


Again here is the template to structure your JSON output (please make sure that you use ',' delimiter after each entry): 

{
    "answer": allowed values are "high-grade" or "low-grade",
    "score": a valid floating point value from 0.0 to 1.0 
}

Begin your response with '{' and end with '}'. Do not use markdown code fences.

Please note, even if think that the image provided is not an MRI scan of a brain glioma, please always stick to the template above, by only giving an answer as a valid string and a score as a valid float and nothing else! Please avoid returning None for the score, please always give a floating point value for the score!
