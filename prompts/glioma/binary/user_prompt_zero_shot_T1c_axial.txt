Good answers:
- contain only "high-grade" or "low-grade" as valid answers in the "answer" field with no punctuation and in this exact format

The patient's image is a T1-weighted, Fat-Saturated, Gadolinium-Enhanced MRI sequence (T1FsGd) representing an axial volume slice showing the biggest tumor area.

1. Have a look at the patient image that is provided below. Take a deep breath and think about wheter you see patterns of high-grade or low-grade soft-tissue sarcoma given all your knowledge you have in radiology.
2. Finalize your answer with a score. As an example, a score of 1 means you are 100% sure to see a high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma, a score of 0 means you see a low-grade soft-tissue sarcoma in the image. A score close to 0.6 means you had to guess, but you tend towards seeing a high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma. The answer should contain "high-grade" or "low-grade" only. 

Here are some considerations to take into account:
- On post-contrast T1-weighted fat-suppressed (T1FsGd) imaging, the primary diagnostic distinction between low-grade and high-grade soft-tissue sarcomas** lies in the pattern and intensity of contrast enhancement and the degree of internal heterogeneity after gadolinium administration. Fat suppression removes bright fat signal, thereby emphasizing contrast-enhancing tumor components, non-enhancing necrotic regions, and peritumoral edema with greater clarity.
- A low-grade sarcoma typically demonstrates homogeneous or mildly heterogeneous enhancement with smooth, well-defined margins and limited surrounding edema. In contrast, a high-grade sarcoma generally exhibits markedly heterogeneous enhancement with non-enhancing necrotic cores, peripheral or septal enhancement, and ill-defined, infiltrative borders extending into adjacent structures. Prominent peritumoral enhancement or irregular peripheral enhancement patterns may suggest tumor angiogenesis, characteristic of aggressive disease.
- On T1FsGd, a low-grade sarcoma enhances uniformly, with clear margins and limited edema, reflecting more organized tumor architecture. A high-grade sarcoma shows marked enhancement heterogeneity, non-enhancing necrotic cores, and ill-defined borders, reflecting aggressive vascular proliferation, necrosis, and infiltrative growth.
- In low-grade sarcomas, enhancement after gadolinium administration is typically mild to moderate and appears relatively homogeneous throughout the lesion.
- In high-grade sarcomas, enhancement is usually strong, irregular, and markedly heterogeneous, reflecting necrotic and highly vascularized tumor components.
- Low-grade sarcomas generally show little or no non-enhancing tissue, indicating preserved viability of most tumor cells.
- High-grade sarcomas, in contrast, frequently contain central or patchy areas that fail to enhance, corresponding to necrosis or cystic degeneration caused by rapid tumor growth and poor perfusion.
- Low-grade sarcomas tend to have smooth, well-defined, and sometimes encapsulated borders that clearly separate them from surrounding structures.
- High-grade sarcomas often demonstrate ill-defined or infiltrative margins with irregular peripheral enhancement, suggesting aggressive invasion into adjacent tissue planes.
- In low-grade sarcomas, peritumoral edema is minimal or absent, and surrounding tissues show little reactive enhancement.
- High-grade sarcomas frequently exhibit extensive peritumoral edema and irregular enhancement in nearby soft tissues, consistent with inflammatory or infiltrative tumor spread.
- Low-grade sarcomas display few or thin internal septa with regular, smooth enhancement patterns, reflecting limited vascular proliferation.
- High-grade sarcomas, on the other hand, often contain thick, irregular, and markedly enhancing septations that indicate pronounced neovascularization and intratumoral complexity.
- Low-grade sarcomas typically appear compact, organized, and confined, with little disruption of normal tissue planes.
- High-grade sarcomas present as bulky, disorganized masses with heterogeneous internal architecture, containing areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, and irregular enhancement patterns suggestive of high biological aggressiveness.


Again here is the template to structure your JSON output. Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. 

{
    "answer": allowed values are "high-grade" or "low-grade",
    "score": a valid floating point value from 0.0 to 1.0 
}

Begin your response with '{' and end with '}'. Do not use markdown code fences.

Please note, even if think that the image provided is not an MRI scan of a soft tissue sarcoma, please always stick to the template above, by only giving an answer as a valid string and a score as a valid float and nothing else! Please avoid returning None for the score, please always give a floating point value for the score!
