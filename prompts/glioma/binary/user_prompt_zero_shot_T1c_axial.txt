Good answers contain only "high-grade" or "low-grade" as valid answers in the "answer" field with no punctuation and in this exact format

The patient's image originates from a post-contrast T1-weighted (T1c) MRI sequence representing an axial volume slice showing the slice with the biggest tumor area.

1. Have a look at the patient image that is provided below. Take a deep breath and think about wheter you see patterns of high-grade or low-grade brain glioma given all your knowledge you have in radiology.
2. Finalize your answer with a score. As an example, a score of 1 means you are 100% sure to see a high-grade brain glioma, a score of 0 means you see a low-grade brain glioma in the image. A score close to 0.6 means you had to guess, but you tend towards seeing a high-grade brain glioma. The answer should contain "high-grade" or "low-grade" only. 

Here are some considerations to take into account when distinguishing between high-grade and low-grade gliomas:

| **Feature**                              | **Low-grade (WHO CNS Grade 2–3)**              | **High-grade (WHO CNS Grade 4)**                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Contrast enhancement**                 | None or faint, often homogeneous               | Strong, heterogeneous, or ring-like enhancement                           |
| **Signal intensity (enhancing regions)** | Iso- to mildly hyperintense relative to cortex | Markedly hyperintense enhancing rim with central hypointensity (necrosis) |
| **Necrosis / cystic areas**              | Absent or minimal                              | Common; appear as central non-enhancing (dark) areas                      |
| **Tumor margins**                        | Smooth, well-defined                           | Irregular, ill-defined, and infiltrative                                  |
| **Peritumoral edema**                    | Minimal or mild; often not visible on T1c      | Extensive low-signal regions surrounding enhancement                      |
| **Mass effect**                          | Mild, proportional to lesion volume            | Pronounced; often disproportionate to enhancing core                      |
| **Midline involvement**                  | Rare                                           | Possible (“butterfly” configuration across corpus callosum)               |
| **Enhancement pattern**                  | Absent or patchy (if grade 3)                  | Thick, irregular, or ring-like; may surround necrotic center              |
| **Vascularity (appearance)**             | Low; no visible abnormal vessels               | High; prominent enhancement due to neovascularization                     |
| **Heterogeneity**                        | Low (uniform internal signal)                  | High (mixed enhancing, necrotic, and hemorrhagic components)              |


Again here is the template to structure your JSON output (please make sure that you use ',' delimiter after each entry): 

{
    "answer": allowed values are "high-grade" or "low-grade",
    "score": a valid floating point value from 0.0 to 1.0 
}

Begin your response with '{' and end with '}'. Do not use markdown code fences.

Please note, even if think that the image provided is not an MRI scan of a brain glioma, please always stick to the template above, by only giving an answer as a valid string and a score as a valid float and nothing else! Please avoid returning None for the score, please always give a floating point value for the score!
