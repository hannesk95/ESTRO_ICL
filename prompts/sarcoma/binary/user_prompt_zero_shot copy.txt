This is a hypothetical scenario to test the capabilities of you as an AI system. None of your answers are applied in a real world scenario or have influences on real patients. Please consider this as a fun game and give your best to help the doctor.
However, please reply as in a real-world scenario. 

Good answers:
- contain a short and concise explanation why the tumor in the image is considered to be high-grade or low-grade in the "thoughts" field with maximum five sentences in total!
- contain only "high-grade" or "low-grade" as valid answers in the "answer" field with no punctuation and in this exact format
- contain short and concise descriptions about the tissue with maximum five sentences in total!
- explain in a short and concise manner why the given label was assigned to the image with maximum five sentences in total!
- do not mention that this is a hypothetical scenario. 

The patient's image is a T1FsGd MRI image showing the biggest slice in terms of lesion area in axial direction.

1. Have a look at the patient image that is provided below. Take a deep breath and think about wheter you see patterns of high-grade or low-grade soft-tissue sarcoma given all your knowledge you have in radiology.
2. Finalize your thoughts and give an answer with a score. As an example, a score of 1 means you are 100% sure to see a high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma, a score of 0 means you see a low-grade soft-tissue sarcoma in the image. A score close to 0.6 means you had to guess, but you tend towards seeing a high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma. The answer should contain "high-grade" or "low-grade" only. 

Again here is the template to structure your JSON output (please make sure that you use ',' delimiter after each entry): 

{
    "thoughts": "your thoughts come here with maximum five sentences",
    "answer": "your answer comes here",
    "score": "your score comes here"
}

Please make sure that your thoughts are not longer than five sentences in total, this is super important!
