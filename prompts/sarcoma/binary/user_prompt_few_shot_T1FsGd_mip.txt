Good answers:
- contain only "high-grade" or "low-grade" as valid answers in the "answer" field with no punctuation and in this exact format


The patient's image is a T1-weighted, Fat-Saturated, Gadolinium-Enhanced MRI sequence (T1FsGd) representing an maximum intensity projection of the 3D volume into a 2D image along the axial direction.


To help you finding the correct answer, we additionally provide you with example images from other patients together with their tumor grade.

Follow the steps below:

1. Take your time to think carefully about these images. Try to find and learn the patterns that distinguish the tissue types.
Here are some considerations to take into account:
- On post-contrast T1-weighted fat-suppressed (T1FsGd) imaging, the primary diagnostic distinction between low-grade and high-grade soft-tissue sarcomas** lies in the pattern and intensity of contrast enhancement and the degree of internal heterogeneity after gadolinium administration. Fat suppression removes bright fat signal, thereby emphasizing contrast-enhancing tumor components, non-enhancing necrotic regions, and peritumoral edema with greater clarity.
- A low-grade sarcoma typically demonstrates homogeneous or mildly heterogeneous enhancement with smooth, well-defined margins and limited surrounding edema. In contrast, a high-grade sarcoma generally exhibits markedly heterogeneous enhancement with non-enhancing necrotic cores, peripheral or septal enhancement, and ill-defined, infiltrative borders extending into adjacent structures. Prominent peritumoral enhancement or irregular peripheral enhancement patterns may suggest tumor angiogenesis, characteristic of aggressive disease.
- On T1FsGd, a low-grade sarcoma enhances uniformly, with clear margins and limited edema, reflecting more organized tumor architecture. A high-grade sarcoma shows marked enhancement heterogeneity, non-enhancing necrotic cores, and ill-defined borders, reflecting aggressive vascular proliferation, necrosis, and infiltrative growth.
- In low-grade sarcomas, enhancement after gadolinium administration is typically mild to moderate and appears relatively homogeneous throughout the lesion.
- In high-grade sarcomas, enhancement is usually strong, irregular, and markedly heterogeneous, reflecting necrotic and highly vascularized tumor components.
- Low-grade sarcomas generally show little or no non-enhancing tissue, indicating preserved viability of most tumor cells.
- High-grade sarcomas, in contrast, frequently contain central or patchy areas that fail to enhance, corresponding to necrosis or cystic degeneration caused by rapid tumor growth and poor perfusion.
- Low-grade sarcomas tend to have smooth, well-defined, and sometimes encapsulated borders that clearly separate them from surrounding structures.
- High-grade sarcomas often demonstrate ill-defined or infiltrative margins with irregular peripheral enhancement, suggesting aggressive invasion into adjacent tissue planes.
- In low-grade sarcomas, peritumoral edema is minimal or absent, and surrounding tissues show little reactive enhancement.
- High-grade sarcomas frequently exhibit extensive peritumoral edema and irregular enhancement in nearby soft tissues, consistent with inflammatory or infiltrative tumor spread.
- Low-grade sarcomas display few or thin internal septa with regular, smooth enhancement patterns, reflecting limited vascular proliferation.
- High-grade sarcomas, on the other hand, often contain thick, irregular, and markedly enhancing septations that indicate pronounced neovascularization and intratumoral complexity.
- Low-grade sarcomas typically appear compact, organized, and confined, with little disruption of normal tissue planes.
- High-grade sarcomas present as bulky, disorganized masses with heterogeneous internal architecture, containing areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, and irregular enhancement patterns suggestive of high biological aggressiveness.

2. Now have a detailed look at the patient image that is provided below. Take a deep breath and think about what you see in the image. It is significant that you have a focus on every detail.
   Compare what you see in the patient image to the tissue features you learned from the examples.
3. If you are not sure about your answer, follow these steps:
    - Remember what you have seen in the example images.
    - Compare the patient's image with the patterns you have learned about high-grade and low-grade sarcomas.
    - Pay attention to carefully follow the considerations from step 1.
    - Think carefully if the examples can help you in finding the answer and make a decision.
4. Finally, generate an output regarding your final thoughts.
- State your final conclusion as "high-grade" or "low-grade" (answer).
- Provide a score (a floating point value between 0 and 1) that reflects the confidence you have in your answer. 1 means you are 100% sure about your decision, 0 means you did not know and completely guessed.
- Whenever you are not sure you are kindly asked to make an informed guess about the diagnosis as best as you can.

Again here is the template to structure your JSON output (please make sure that you use ',' delimiter after each entry): 

{
    "answer": allowed values are "high-grade" or "low-grade",
    "score": a valid floating point value from 0.0 to 1.0 
}


Begin your response with '{' and end with '}'. Do not use markdown code fences.

Please note, even if think that the image provided is not an MRI scan of a soft tissue sarcoma, please always stick to the template above, by only giving an answer as a valid string and a score as a valid float and nothing else! Please avoid returning None for the score, please always give a floating point value for the score!
