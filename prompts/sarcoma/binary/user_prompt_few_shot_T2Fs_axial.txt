Good answers:
- contain only "high-grade" or "low-grade" as valid answers in the "answer" field with no punctuation and in this exact format


The patient's image is a T2-weighted, Fat-Saturated MRI sequence (T2Fs) representing an axial volume slice showing the biggest tumor area.


To help you finding the correct answer, we additionally provide you with example images from other patients together with their tumor grade.

Follow the steps below:

1. Take your time to think carefully about these images. Try to find and learn the patterns that distinguish the tissue types.
Here are some considerations to take into account:
- On T2-weighted fat-suppressed (T2Fs) imaging, the primary diagnostic distinction between low-grade and high-grade soft-tissue sarcomas lies in the degree of internal signal heterogeneity, extent of peritumoral edema, and definition of tumor margins. Fat suppression eliminates bright fat signal, enhancing visualization of fluid-rich, edematous, and necrotic tumor components, as well as subtle infiltration into adjacent tissues.
- A low-grade sarcoma typically demonstrates relatively homogeneous intermediate-to-mildly high T2 signal intensity with smooth, well-defined margins and minimal surrounding edema. In contrast, a high-grade sarcoma generally exhibits markedly heterogeneous T2 hyperintensity with internal necrotic or cystic regions, thick irregular septations, and ill-defined, infiltrative borders extending into adjacent structures. Prominent peritumoral high-signal regions or irregular peripheral hyperintensity patterns may indicate tumor-associated edema and infiltration, characteristic of aggressive disease.
- On T2Fs, a low-grade sarcoma appears uniformly or mildly hyperintense with clear margins and limited peritumoral signal abnormality, reflecting more organized tissue architecture and lower water content. A high-grade sarcoma shows marked internal signal heterogeneity with hyperintense necrotic cores, thick internal septa, and ill-defined margins, reflecting aggressive growth, necrosis, and stromal disorganization.
- In low-grade sarcomas, T2 signal intensity is typically homogeneous and moderately increased, with uniform internal texture and few or no necrotic foci.
- In high-grade sarcomas, T2 signal intensity is usually very high and markedly heterogeneous, with irregular areas of cystic or necrotic change corresponding to regions of tissue breakdown and increased water content.
- Low-grade sarcomas generally show little or no central fluid-like regions, indicating preserved cellular organization and limited necrosis.
- High-grade sarcomas, in contrast, frequently contain central or patchy areas of very high T2 signal, corresponding to necrosis or cystic degeneration caused by rapid tumor growth and poor perfusion.
- Low-grade sarcomas tend to have smooth, well-defined, and sometimes encapsulated borders that clearly separate them from surrounding muscle and fat.
- High-grade sarcomas often demonstrate ill-defined or infiltrative margins with irregular extensions into adjacent tissues, suggesting aggressive invasion beyond fascial boundaries.
- In low-grade sarcomas, peritumoral edema is minimal or absent, and surrounding tissues show little or no T2 hyperintensity.
- High-grade sarcomas frequently exhibit extensive peritumoral edema with high T2 signal intensity in nearby soft tissues, consistent with inflammatory or infiltrative tumor spread.
- Low-grade sarcomas display few or thin internal septa with smooth, regular morphology, reflecting limited fibrous stroma and vascular proliferation.
- High-grade sarcomas, on the other hand, often contain thick, irregular, and markedly hyperintense septations that indicate pronounced stromal reaction, neovascularization, and intratumoral complexity.
- Low-grade sarcomas typically appear compact, organized, and confined, with preservation of normal tissue planes and limited surrounding edema.
- High-grade sarcomas present as bulky, disorganized masses with heterogeneous internal architecture, containing areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, and irregular T2 hyperintensity patterns suggestive of high biological aggressiveness.

2. Now have a detailed look at the patient image that is provided below. Take a deep breath and think about what you see in the image. It is significant that you have a focus on every detail.
   Compare what you see in the patient image to the tissue features you learned from the examples.
3. If you are not sure about your answer, follow these steps:
    - Remember what you have seen in the example images.
    - Compare the patient's image with the patterns you have learned about high-grade and low-grade sarcomas.
    - Pay attention to carefully follow the considerations from step 1.
    - Think carefully if the examples can help you in finding the answer and make a decision.
4. Finally, generate an output regarding your final thoughts.
- State your final conclusion as "high-grade" or "low-grade" (answer).
- Provide a score (a floating point value between 0 and 1) that reflects the confidence you have in your answer. 1 means you are 100% sure about your decision, 0 means you did not know and completely guessed.
- Whenever you are not sure you are kindly asked to make an informed guess about the diagnosis as best as you can.

Again here is the template to structure your JSON output (please make sure that you use ',' delimiter after each entry): 

{
    "answer": allowed values are "high-grade" or "low-grade",
    "score": a floating point value from 0 to 1.
}


Begin your response with '{' and end with '}'. Do not use markdown code fences.

Please note, even if think that the image provided is not an MRI scan of a soft tissue sarcoma, please always stick to the template above, by only giving an answer and a score and nothing else!
