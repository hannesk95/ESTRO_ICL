Good answers:
- contain only "high-grade" or "low-grade" as valid answers in the "answer" field with no punctuation and in this exact format

The images are T1FsGd MRI showing the biggest slice in terms of lesion area in axial direction.


To help you finding the correct answer, we additionally provide you with example images from other patients together with their actual tumor grade.

1. Take your time to think carefully about these images. Try to find and learn the patterns that distinguish images of high-grade from low-grade soft-tissue sarcomas.
2. Then have a look at the patient image that is provided below. Take a deep breath and think about wheter you see patterns of high-grade or low-grade given all your knowledge.
   If you are sure about the tumor grade, do not think about the examples you have seen. Be unbiased and provide youre answer. 
3. If you are not sure about the tumor grade, follow these steps:
    - Remember what you have seen in the example images. 
    - Think carefully if they could help you in finding an answer.
    - Then go to point 4. 
4. Finalize your answer with a score. As an example, a score of 1 means you are 100% sure to see a high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma, a score of 0 means you see a low-grade soft-tissue sarcoma in the image. A score close to 0.6 means you had to guess, but you tend towards seeing a high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma. The answer should contain "high-grade" or "low-grade" only. 

Again here is the template to structure your JSON output. Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else. 

{
    "answer": "your answer comes here",
    "score": "your score comes here"
}

Begin your response with '{' and end with '}'. Do not use markdown code fences.

We first provide you with example images and their corresponding grade. The last image is the actual patient image we ask you to predict the tumor grade.
